            My name is Richin Mrudul, and I am currently a Computer Science student at Purdue University.
            I am highly motivated and passionate about exploring new opportunities within the field of technology. 
            I am eager to learn, grow, and continually expand my skill set. With a strong drive to improve, 
            I am open to any opportunity that allows me to contribute meaningfully while enhancing my knowledge 
            and abilities in computer science.

          <p className="mt-2 text-gray-300">
          Apart from my passion for technology, I enjoy spending time with my friends and going on walks,  
          always looking for new places to explore. I grew up in Sacramento, California, but now I'm 
          living mainly in Indiana, embracing new experiences along the way.  

          As a big basketball fan, Iâ€™ve always supported the Sacramento Kings,  
          and I love the energy and excitement of the game. I'm also a huge 
          foodie, with a deep appreciation for Thai and Indian cuisine.  
          Whether it's a homecooked meal or trying a new restaurant, I'm 
          always down.

              Music has been a significant part of my life. I play the guitar, drums, and chenda. 
              Listening to music is just as important to me as playing instruments, and some of my favorite artists 
              include Daniel Caesar, Kanye West, SZA, Drake, and Maroon 5.
